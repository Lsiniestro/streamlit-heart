# Heart failure prediction

Prediction of having a heart failure based on the data set from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data

Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.

Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.

I developed this model to predict if you have any risk of having souch event.






## Usage

To use it you need some medical data souch as: ejection fraction, serum creatinine and serum sodium. Those parameters are the most relevant to predict a heart failure.
Just move the sliders to select the values and then click on the "Predict" button
